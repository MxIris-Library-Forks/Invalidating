# Invalidating

A property wrapper that backports the new `@Invalidating` property wrapper to older versions. For more information on this new property wrapper, see the WWDC 2021 talk ["What's new in AppKit"](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10054) for a brief introduction.

When it's time to finally update your project to iOS 15/tvOS 15/macOS 12, you can remove this package without basically having to make any changes to your code! âœ¨

## Usage

Annotate your `Equatable` properties with `@Invalidating` and provide configuration options that will be used to trigger updates on the view whenever the property changes:

```swift
final class MyView: UIView {
  // Calls setNeedsLayout()
  @Invalidating(.layout) var cornerRadius: CGFloat = 0.5
  
  // Calls setNeedsLayout() then setNeedsUpdateConstraints()
  @Invalidating(.layout, .constraints) var heightConstraintValue: CFloat = 200
  
  // Calls setNeedsLayout() then setNeedsUpdateConstraints() then invalidateIntrinsicContentSize()
  @Invalidating(.layout, .constraints, .intrinsicContentSize) var magicProperty: CGFloat = 1234
```

### Adding custom invalidators

You can add custom invalidators by creating a type that conforms to `UIViewInvalidating` or `NSViewInvalidating` protocol (depending on the target platform) and implementing the `invalidate` method requirement:

```swift
extension UIView.Invalidations {
  struct State: UIViewInvalidating {
    static let state: Self = .init()

    func invalidate(view: UIView) {
      // Your custom logic to invalidate some state on the view
    }
  }
}
```

You can then expose it to the property wrapper by extending the `InvalidatingStaticMember` type:

```swift
extension InvalidatingStaticMember where Base: UIViewInvalidating {
  static var state: InvalidatingStaticMember<UIView.Invalidations.State> { .init(.state) }
}
```

Then you can use it on `@Invalidating`:

```swift
final class MyView: UIView {

  // Calls setNeedsLayout() and State.invalidate(self)
  @Invalidating(.layout, .state) var customProperty: CGFloat = 1.0
}
```

#### Note: 

When you update to iOS 15/tvOS 15/macOS 12, you will need to update the above extension to:

```swift
extension UIViewInvalidating where Self == UIView.Invalidations.State {
  static var state: Self { .state }
}
```

The `InvalidatingStaticMember` type only exists to workaround some language limitations which have been addressed in Swift 5.5, so you will need to make the tweak above for your existing code to compile.

## Extending `@Invalidating` to accept more values

By default, you can provide up to 3 options (say `.layout, .display, .custom`) to the property wrapper, however you can provide custom initializers so the property wrapper can be initialized with a larger set of customization options. This can be done by utilizing the built-in `Tuple` type. For example, here's how you can provide an intializer so `@Invalidating` can take up to 4 values:

```swift
extension UIView.Invalidating {
  convenience init<InvalidationType2: UIViewInvalidating, InvalidationType3: UIViewInvalidating, InvalidationType4: UIViewInvalidating>(wrappedValue: Value, _ invalidation1: InvalidationType.Member, _ invalidation2: InvalidationType2.Member, _ invalidation3: InvalidationType3.Member, _ invalidation4: InvalidationType4.Member) {
    self.init(wrappedValue: wrappedValue, invalidation1, .init(Tuple(invalidation1: invalidation2.base, invalidation2: Tuple(invalidation1: invalidation3.base, invalidation2: invalidation4.base))))
  }
}
```

## Requirements

- iOS 13+, tvOS 13+ or macOS 10.15+
- Swift 5.3 or above

## Note

Add the following to your project's `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/theblixguy/Invalidating", from: "0.0.1")
```

or add this package via the Xcode UI by going to File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency.
