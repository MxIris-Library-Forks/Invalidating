# Invalidating

A property wrapper that backports the new `@Invalidating` property wrapper to older versions of iOS/tvOS/macOS. For more information on this new property wrapper, see the WWDC 2021 talk ["What's new in AppKit"](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10054) for a brief introduction.

The syntax and types closely follows what Apple is doing, so when it's time to finally update your project's deployment target to iOS 15+/tvOS 15+/macOS 12+, you can remove this package without basically having to make any changes to your code! âœ¨

## Usage

Annotate your `Equatable` properties with `@Invalidating` and provide options that will be used to invalidate the view whenever the property's value changes:

```swift
final class MyView: UIView {
  // Calls setNeedsLayout()
  @Invalidating(.layout) var cornerRadius: CGFloat = 0.5
  
  // Calls setNeedsLayout() then setNeedsUpdateConstraints()
  @Invalidating(.layout, .constraints) var heightConstraintValue: CFloat = 200
  
  // Calls setNeedsLayout() then setNeedsUpdateConstraints() then invalidateIntrinsicContentSize()
  @Invalidating(.layout, .constraints, .intrinsicContentSize) var magicProperty: CGFloat = 1234
```

You can initialize the property wrapper with up to 10 options. You can of course add extensions to support more options though, but realistically speaking you'll likely never have a need to pass more than a few of them!

By default, there is support for a total of 5 invalidation options per platform:

#### Common
- Layout
- Display
- Constraints
- Intrinsic Size

#### macOS only
- Restorable State

#### iOS 14+ only
- Configuration

### Adding custom invalidators

You can add custom invalidators by creating a type that conforms to `UIViewInvalidating` or `NSViewInvalidating` protocol (depending on the target platform) and implementing the `invalidate` method requirement:

```swift
extension UIView.Invalidations {
  struct Focus: UIViewInvalidating {
    static let focus: Self = .init()

    func invalidate(view: UIView) {
      view.setNeedsFocusUpdate()
    }
  }
}
```

You can then expose it to the property wrapper by extending the `InvalidatingStaticMember` type:

```swift
extension InvalidatingStaticMember where Base: UIViewInvalidating {
  static var focus: InvalidatingStaticMember<UIView.Invalidations.Focus> { .init(.focus) }
}
```

> #### Note: 

> If you're using Xcode 13, you should do this instead:

> ```swift
> extension UIViewInvalidating where Self == UIView.Invalidations.Focus {
>  static var focus: Self { .focus }
> }
> ```

> The `InvalidatingStaticMember` type only exists to workaround some language limitations which have been addressed in Swift 5.5, which ships with Xcode 13. So if you're on the latest Xcode, you do not need to use the workaround.

Then you can use your new invalidator on `@Invalidating`:

```swift
final class MyView: UIView {

  // Calls setNeedsLayout() and Focus.invalidate(self)
  @Invalidating(.layout, .focus) var customProperty: CGFloat = 1.0
}
```

## Requirements

- Deployment target of iOS 11+, tvOS 11+ or macOS 10.11+
- Xcode 11 or above

## Installation

Add the following to your project's `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/theblixguy/Invalidating", from: "0.0.4")
```

or add this package via the Xcode UI by going to File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency.
